genetic_models.py

Genetic models take a family object with individuals and variants and annotates
for each variant which models they follow in this family.

The following models are checked:

- Autosomal Dominant(AD)
- Autosomal Dominant De Novo(AD_DN)
- Autosomal Recessive(AR_hom)
- Autosomal Recessive De Novo(AR_DN)
- Autosomal Recesive Compound(AR_comp).

In this model a variant must imply affected status, otherwise it can not be 
dominant. All sick has to be ay least heterozygote for the variant and all 
healthy can not have it.

We will assume that each individual that we have information about is present
among the individual in self.family.individuals.


is the individual sick?

    - If the individual is homozygote alternative then AD/AD-denovo 
        and AR/AR-denovo are ok

    - If the individual is is heterozygote then AD/AD-denovo are ok 
        but AR/AR-denovo are not ok

    - If the individual is homozygote reference no model is ok

    - If the individual has no call all models are ok



is the individual healthy?

    - If the individual is homozygote alternative then no model is ok

    - If the individual is heterozygote then AR/AR-denove are ok but 
        AD/AD-denovo are not ok

    - If the individual is homozygote referense all models are ok

    - If there is no call all models are ok



is there no known phenotype?

    - All models are ok for all variants
