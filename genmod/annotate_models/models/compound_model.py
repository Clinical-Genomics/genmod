    Check if two variants of a pair follow the compound heterozygous model.

    At this stage we know:
        - None of the individuals are homozygote alternative for the variants
        - All affected individuals are heterozygote for both variants.

    We do not allow healthy individuals to be heterozygote for both variants
    in the pair
    (ref.
    http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0070151)

    If the individuals are phased we will only consider pairs that are on
    different alleles in affected individuals.

    Args:

        family: A family object with the individuals
