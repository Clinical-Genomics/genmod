## Conditions for Genetic Models ##

### Short explanation of genotype calls in VCF format:###

Since we only look at humans, that are diploid, the genotypes represent what we see on both alleles in a single position.
``0`` represents the reference sequence, ``1`` is the first of the alternative alleles, ``2`` second alternative and so on.
If no phasing has been done the genotype is an unordered pair on the form ``x/x``, so ``0/1`` means that the individual is heterozygote in this given position with the reference base on one of the alleles and the first of the alternatives on the other.
``2/2`` means that we see the second of the alternatives on both alleles.
Some chromosomes are only present in one copy in humans, here it is allowed to only use a single digit to show the genotype. A ``0`` would mean reference and ``1`` first of alternatives.

If phasing has been done the pairs are not unordered anymore and the delimiter is then changed to '|', so one can be heterozygote in two ways; ``0|1`` or ``1|0``.


### Autosomal Recessive ###

For this model individuals can be carriers so healthy individuals can be heterozygous. Both alleles need to have the variant for an individual to be sick so a healthy individual can not be homozygous alternative and a sick individual *has* to be homozygous alternative.

* Affected individuals have to be homozygous alternative (hom. alt.)
* Healthy individuals cannot be hom. alt.
* Variant is considered _de novo_ if both parents are genotyped and do not carry the variant
* The variants following this modell will be annotated with ``AR_hom``, or ``AR_hom_dn`` for de novo


### Autosomal Dominant ###

* Affected individuals have to be heterozygous (het.)
* Healthy individuals cannot have the alternative variant
* Variant is considered _de novo_ if both parents are genotyped and do not carry the variant
* The variants following this modell will be annotated with ``AD``or ``AD_dn``

**Special Case:** If the variant belongs to a gene that have been annotated 
with reduced penetrance we will allow healthy carriers. (i.e. healthy individuals can be heterozygotes)

### Autosomal Compound Heterozygote ###

This model includes pairs of variants that are present within the same gene.

1. Non-phased data:
	* Affected individuals have to be het. for both variants
	* Healthy individuals can be het. for one of the variants but cannot have both variants
	* Variant is considered _de novo_ if only one or no variant is found in the parents


2. Phased data:
	* All affected individuals have to be het. for both variants **and** the variants has to be on two different alleles
	* Healthy individuals can be heterozygous for one but cannot have both variants
	* If only one or no variant is found in parents it is considered _de novo_


Variant following this patters will be annotated with ``AR_comp`` or ``AR_comp_dn``

### X-Linked Dominant###

These traits are inherited on the x-chromosome, of which men have one allele and women have two.

* Variant has to be on chromosome X
* Affected individuals have to be het. or hom. alt.
* Healthy males cannot carry the variant
* Healthy females can carry the variant (because of X inactivation)
* If sex is male the variant is considered _de novo_ if mother is genotyped and does not carry the variant
* If sex is female variant is considered _de novo_ if none of the parents carry the variant
* The variants following this modell will be annotated with ``XD``or ``XD_dn``


### X Linked Recessive ###

* Variant has to be on chromosome X
* Affected males have to be het. or hom. alt. (het is theoretically not possible in males, but can occur due to Pseudo Autosomal Regions).
* Healthy males cannot carry the variant
* Affected females have to be hom. alt.
* Healthy females cannot be hom. alt.
* If sex is male the variant is considered _de novo_ if mother is genotyped and does not carry the variant
* If sex is female variant is considered _de novo_ if not both parents carry the variant
* The variants following this modell will be annotated with ``XR``or ``XR_dn``
